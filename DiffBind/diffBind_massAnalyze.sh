# Calls most recent version of diffBind_analyze.sh, but also takes in a meta file to mass process the samples

# This pipeline requires one positional argument:
# 	$1 - The meta file that has all the comparisons that need to be made
# The file should be tab-delimited, and contain the following fields:
# categoryForComparison sampleGroup controlGroup  rObjToRead

# Requires the ATACQC pipeline (will rename in the future)

# TODO: Merge with diffBind_analyze.sh such that if only one field is provided, assume that it is a meta file
# But, if three categories are provided, use those three categories to run as it is right now. 
# Break on two

#  All the parameters are not provided
